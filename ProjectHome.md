You are an archaeologist trapped in an underground crypt with a limited supply of air.
You must survive long enough to reach the crypt's exit.

  * Be too rash - and the arachnids will nibble you to death.
  * Be too wary - and your air supply will run out.

Luckily, the ancients have left behind med packs, air cans and batteries in the crypt - use them wisely!
